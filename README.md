# Build Your Own wc (Word Count) Command

Welcome to the "Build Your Own wc (Word Count) Command" challenge! In this project, you'll be creating your own version of the Unix command-line tool `wc`, which stands for "word count." This tool is a classic example of a simple and powerful utility in the Unix philosophy.

## Challenge Overview

The Unix command-line tools exemplify good software engineering practices and adhere to the Unix Philosophies, including:

1. **Writing Simple Parts Connected by Clean Interfaces:** Each Unix tool does one thing and does it well, offering a simple command-line interface that can handle text input from files or streams.

2. **Designing Programs to be Connected to Other Programs:** These tools can easily be combined with other tools, allowing for the creation of sophisticated text data processing pipelines.

By following these philosophies, Unix command-line tools have become essential in software development and data engineering, enabling the construction of complex data processing workflows from simple, modular components.

## Getting Started

Before you begin the challenge, make sure you have the necessary tools and environment set up:

- [Install a Unix-like operating system (e.g., Linux or macOS)](https://www.linux.org/pages/download/).
- Familiarize yourself with basic Unix commands and the command-line interface (CLI).
- Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., Python, C, or Shell) for implementing the `wc` command.

## Challenge Objectives

Your task is to create a `wc`-like command-line tool that counts words, lines, and characters in a given text input. Here are the main objectives:

- Implement a command-line interface that accepts input from files or standard input (stdin).
- Count the number of words in the input text.
- Count the number of lines in the input text.
- Count the number of characters in the input text.
- Provide a user-friendly way to display the results.
